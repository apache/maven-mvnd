== Introduction

This project aims at providing faster https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] builds using techniques known from Gradle and
Takari.

Architecture overview:

* `mvnd` embeds Maven (so there is no need to install Maven separately).
* The actual builds happen inside a long living background process, a.k.a. daemon.
* One daemon instance can serve multiple consecutive requests from the `mvnd` client.
* The `mvnd` client is a native executable built using https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[GraalVM].
  It starts faster and uses less memory compared to starting a traditional JVM.
* Multiple daemons can be spawned in parallel if there is no idle daemon to serve a build request.

This architecture brings the following advantages:

* The JVM for running the actual builds does not need to get started anew for each build.
* The classloaders holding classes of Maven plugins are cached over multiple builds. The plugin jars are thus read
  and parsed just once. SNAPSHOT versions of Maven plugins are not cached.
* The native code produced by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler inside the JVM is kept too. Compared to stock Maven,
  less time is spent by the JIT compilation. During the repeated builds the JIT-optimized code is available
  immediately. This applies not only to the code coming from Maven plugins and Maven Core, but also to all code coming
  from the JDK itself.

== Additional features

`mvnd` brings the following features on top of the stock Maven:

* By default, `mvnd` is building your modules in parallel using multiple CPU cores. The number of utilized cores is
  given by the formula `Math.max(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() - 1, 1)`. If your source tree does not
  support parallel builds, pass `-T1` on the command line to make your build serial.
* Improved console output: we believe that the output of a parallel build on a stock Maven is hard to follow. Therefore,
we implemented a simplified a non-rolling view showing the status of each build thread on a separate line. This is
what it looks like on a machine with 24 cores:

Once the build is finshed, the complete Maven output is forwarded to the console.

== How to install `mvnd`

=== Install using https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!]

If SDKMAN! supports your operating system, it is as easy as

[source,shell]
----
$ sdk install mvnd
----

If you used the manual install in the past, please make sure that the settings in `~/.m2/mvnd.properties` still make
sense. With SDKMAN!, the `~/.m2/mvnd.properties` file is typically not needed at all, because both `JAVA_HOME` and
`MVND_HOME` are managed by SDKMAN!.

=== Install using https://brew.sh/[Homebrew]

[source,shell]
----
$ brew install mvndaemon/homebrew-mvnd/mvnd
----

=== Set up completion

Optionally, you can set up completion as follows:
[source,shell]
----
# ensure to set MVND_HOME to point to your mvnd distribution, note that sdkman does it for you
$ echo 'source $MVND_HOME/bin/mvnd-bash-completion.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
----
`bash` is the only shell supported at this time.

=== Note for oh-my-zsh users ===

Users that use `oh-my-zsh` often use completion for maven.  The default maven completion plugin defines `mvnd` as an alias to `mvn deploy`. So before being able to use `mvnd`, you need to unalias using the following command:
[source,shell]
----
$ unalias mvnd
----


=== Install manually

* Download the latest ZIP suitable for your platform from https://github.com/mvndaemon/mvnd/releases
* Unzip to a directory of your choice
* Add the `bin` directory to `PATH`
* Optionally, you can create `~/.m2/mvnd.properties` and set the `java.home` property in case you do not want to bother
  with setting `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
* Test whether `mvnd` works:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ mvnd --version
Maven Daemon 0.0.11-linux-amd64 (native)
Terminal: org.jline.terminal.impl.PosixSysTerminal with pty org.jline.terminal.impl.jansi.osx.OsXNativePty

If you are on Windows and see a message that `VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found`, you need to install
`vc_redist.x64.exe` from https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads.
See https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1762 for more information.


== Usage

`mvnd` is designed to accept the same command line options like stock `mvn` (plus some extras - see below), e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
mvnd clean install
----

== `mvnd` specific options

`--status` lists running daemons

`--stop` kills all running daemons

The complete list of options is printed when executing `mvnd --help`.

== Build `mvnd` from source

=== Prerequisites:

* `git`
* Maven
* Download and unpack GraalVM CE from https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases[GitHub]
* Set `JAVA_HOME` to where you unpacked GraalVM in the previous step. Check that `java -version` output is as
  expected:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -version
openjdk version "11.0.9" 2020-10-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 20.3.0 (build 11.0.9+10-jvmci-20.3-b06)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 20.3.0 (build 11.0.9+10-jvmci-20.3-b06, mixed mode, sharing)
----
+
* Install the `native-image` tool:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ $JAVA_HOME/bin/gu install native-image
----

* `native-image` may require additional software to be installed depending on your platform - see the
https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/#prerequisites[`native-image` documentation].

=== Build `mvnd`

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/mvndaemon/mvnd.git
$ cd mvnd
$ mvn clean verify -Pnative
...
$ cd client
$ file target/mvnd
target/mvnd: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=93a554f3807550a13c986d2af9a311ef299bdc5a, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped
$ ls -lh target/mvnd
-rwxrwxr-x. 1 ppalaga ppalaga 25M Jun  2 13:23 target/mvnd
----

=== Known issues and limitations

* `mvnd` generally does not play well with `-rf` Maven option at the moment.
  If your source tree allows for building of some modules in parallel
  and if the failure happens on some of the parallel execution branches,
  there is no guarantee that `mvnd` builds all modules skipped due to the previous failure.
  There are some improvements planned on this in the next `mvnd` releases.

We're happy to improve `mvnd`, so https://github.com/mvndaemon/mvnd/issues[feedback] is most welcomed!
